# Setting Up Your Development Environment

## Installing Eclipse and Tomcat

- I installed JDK 8 on my machine and added set the Java Path variable from this tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-java-path-in-windows-and-linux/

- I installed the latest version eclipse for enterprise developers

- I installed Tomcat 9 to use as a webserver as recommended by the course

- I had to enable the server view in perspective which then brought up the window which enabled me to connect to the Tomcat server

## Spring 5 Jar Files

- We will not use Maven yet for simplicity

- I created a new Java project with name 'spring-demo-one' and create a folder named 'lib' to be alongside src folder
